	        <h2><center>General Islamic Marriage Guidelines</center></h2>
		<h3>Primary Requirements</h3>
			<ol>
			<li>Mutual agreement (Ijab wa Qabul) by the bride and the groom</li>
			<li>Two adult and sensible witnesses</li>
			<li>Mahr (marriage-gift) to be paid by the groom to the bride either immediately (muajjal) or
				deferred (muakhkhar), or a combination of both</li>
			</ol>
		<h3>Secondary Requirements</h3>
			<ol>
				<li> Legal guardian (wakeel) representing the bride. If the bride represents herself then a
				wakeel is no longer required.</li>
				<li>Written marriage contract (“Aqd-Nikah”) signed by the bride and the groom and
				witnessed by two Muslim, adult and sane witnesses.</li>
				<li>Qadi (State appointed Muslim judge).</li>
				<li>Khutba-tun-Nikah to solemnize the marriage.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3>Mahr</h3>
			<p>The marriage-gift (Mahr) is a divine injunction. The giving of mahr to the bride by the groom is
			an essential part of the contract.</br>
			Mahr is a token commitment of the husband’s responsibility and may be paid in cash, property or
			movable objects to the bride herself. The amount of mahr is not legally specified, however,
			moderation according to the existing social norm is recommended. The mahr may be paid
			immediately to the bride at the time of marriage, or deferred to a later date, or a combination of
			both. The deferred mahr however, falls due in case of death or divorce.<br>
			One matrimonial party expresses ‘ijab’ willing consent to enter into marriage and the other party
			expresses ‘qubul’ acceptance of the responsibility in the assembly of marriage ceremony. The
			contract is written and signed by the bride and the groom and their two respective witnesses.
			This written marriage contract (‘Aqd-Nikah) is then announced publicly.</p>

		<h3>Nikah</h3><br>
		<h4><img src="signing.jpg" alt="nikah image"></h4><br>
			<p>The marriage contract is signed in a nikah ceremony,
			in which the groom or his representative proposes to the bride in front of at least two witnesses,
			stating the details of the meher.
			The bride and groom demonstrate their free will by repeating the word qabul ("I accept," in Arabic) three times.
			Then the couple and two male witnesses sign the contract, making the marriage legal according to civil and religious law.
			Following traditional Islamic customs, the bride and groom may share a piece of sweet fruit, such as a date.
			If men and women are separated for the ceremony,
			a male representative called a wali acts on the bride's behalf during the nikah.
</p>

		<h3>The Marriage Banquet (Walima)</h3><br>

			<p>After the ceremony of the marriage (usually next day), the groom holds a banquet called a
		walima. The relatives, neighbors, and friends are invited in order to make them aware of the
		marriage. Both rich and poor of the family and community are invited to the marriage feasts.<br>
				Get ready for food. Lots of it. After the wedding contract is signed, it's time to feast.
				This is called the Walima, and it may feature traditional symbols of fertility and plenty,
				like fish, chicken, rice and candy-covered almonds.
				In some Muslim cultures, the walima lasts for two days, so make sure your clothes have some stretch to them.
				Guests should also be aware that the Muslim faith forbids the consumption of alcohol.
				Don't expect any Champagne toasts at a traditional Muslim wedding.

    <p style="text-align: center;">The most challenging thing about weddings
			is that all that is beautiful is true and all that is true is beautiful.
			As in the movie ‘Il Gattopardo’ by Luchino Visconti where truth corresponds to beauty.”
